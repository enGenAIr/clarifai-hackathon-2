diflucan
Why it's used
Diflucan Capsule is used to treat the fungal infection of the vagina (also called, vaginal candidiasis). This medicine works by preventing the formation of an enzyme (ergosterol) which is necessary for the synthesis of the fungal cell wall. Diflucan Capsule is also used to treat fungal infection of mouth, throat, and pharynx, to treat brain and spinal cord infection (cryptococcal meningitis) in AIDS patients, to prevent fungal infection in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive radiation therapy and chemotherapy, to treat urinary tract infection, to treat inflammation of membrane that covers abdominal organs (peritonitis), to treat pneumonia, to treat fungal infection of the blood (candidemia), to treat fungal infection of internal body organs such as liver, kidney, brain, and heart (disseminated candidiasis), and to treat fungal inflammation of penis head (candidal balanitis).
Azole Antifungal
Diflucan belongs to the Azole Antifungal class of medicines. Azole antifungals are a group of drugs that treat fungal infections of the skin and body, including athlete's foot, fungal nail infections, ringworm, and vaginal candidiasis. These medicines limit the growth of a wide range of fungi by damaging the fungal cell membrane.

Interactions with Diflucan
When two or more medicines are taken together, it can change how the medicines work and increase the risk of side-effects. In medical terms, this is called as a Drug Interaction.
This page does not contain all the possible interactions of Diflucan Capsule. Share a list of all medicines that you use with your doctor and pharmacist. Do not start, stop, or change the dose of any medicines without the approval of your doctor.
Gastroprokinetic Agent
Your doctor's guidelines may need to be followed while taking this medicine along with cisapride, which is used to increase gastric motility. When Diflucan is used with cisapride, there has been a significant increase in cisapride blood levels and abnormal heartbeat (prolongation of QTc interval). Use of both the medicines together is not recommended.
Anticonvulsants
Diflucan Capsule interacts with phenytoin, which is used to treat epilepsy. When Diflucan is used with this medicine, it increases the level of phenytoin in the blood. Such patients should be monitored carefully for elevated phenytoin levels.
Anticoagulants
There may be an interaction of Diflucan with anticoagulants, which are used to prevent blood clot formation. When Diflucan is used with anticoagulants such as coumarin and warfarin, it can cause bleeding problems such as skin injury that results in a discoloration of the skin (bruising), bleeding from nasal cavity (epistaxis), stomach and intestinal bleeding, presence of blood in urine (hematuria), and black tarry stools (melena). These bleeding problems have been reported in along with increasing the blood clotting time in such patients. In such patients, time taken by blood to clot (prothrombin time) should be monitored carefully.
Oral Hypoglycemics
Diflucan Capsule may interact with oral hypoglycemics (tolbutamide, glyburide, and glipizide), which are used to lower the blood glucose levels. This medicine decreases the metabolism of oral hypoglycemic medicines and increases their level in the blood. When Diflucan is used with these medicines, carefully monitoring of blood glucose levels is required. The dose of these medicines should also be adjusted in such patients.
Antihistamines
Special instructions need to be followed while taking this medicine along with antihistamines (terfenadine and astemizole), which are used to relieve allergy symptoms. The patients using these medicines may develop abnormal and prolonged heartbeat. Also, when the combination of these drugs is used at higher doses involving Diflucan 400mg or 800 mg, Diflucan significantly increases the blood levels of terfenadine. Similarly, use of Diflucan with astemizole has resulted in decreased clearance of astemizole. Use of Diflucan and astemizole is not recommended and use of Diflucan with terbinafine at doses lower than 400 mg/day should be monitored carefully.
Your doctor's guidelines may need to be followed while taking this medicine along with Erythromycin. When Diflucan is used with erythromycin, it may increase the risk of abnormal and prolonged heartbeat that may cause heart muscles damage. Avoid using these medicines together.
Opioids Analgesics
Diflucan Capsule interacts with opioid analgesics (fentanyl and alfentanil), which are used to relieve pain. When Diflucan is used with these medicines, it may lead to failure of the lungs to exchange carbon dioxide and oxygen. Due to the possibility of fatal outcomes, avoid using these medicines together. Patients should be monitored closely for the risk of respiratory-depression. Dosage adjustment of alfentanil and fentanyl may be necessary.
Antimalarial Drugs
Special instructions need to be followed while taking this medicine along with antimalarial drugs (halofantrine and quinidine), which are used to treat malaria. When Diflucan is used in combination with halofantrine, it has resulted in increased blood levels of halofantrine due to an inhibitory effect on enzyme CYP3A4. It also increases the risk of heart rhythm disorder (prolonged QT interval, torsades de pointes). These medicines should not be taken together.
Antipsychotic Agent
There may be an interaction of Diflucan with pimozide, which is used to treat mental disorders. When Diflucan is used with this medicine, it increases the level of pimozide in the blood that may result in an abnormal and prolonged heartbeat. Avoid taking both the medicines together.
Antifungal Drugs
Diflucan Capsule may interact with voriconazole, which is used to treat fungal infections. Monitoring of side-effects and damage related to voriconazole is recommended, particularly when voriconazole is started within 24 hour of the last dose of Diflucan. Using both the medicines together should be avoided.
Oral Contraceptives
Diflucan Capsule may interact with oral contraceptives, which are used to prevent pregnancy. When Diflucan is used with these medicines, it affects the efficacy of oral contraceptives.

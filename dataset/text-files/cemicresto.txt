Cemicresto Tablet
Why it's used
Cemicresto Tablet is used to decrease the amount of bad cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein (LDL)) and triglycerides in the blood. This medicine works by slowing down the synthesis of cholesterol in the body. This medicine helps by decreasing the amount of cholesterol that may build up on the walls of the arteries. Cemicresto is also used to raise the amounts of good cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein (HDL)) in the blood, to decrease the amount of cholesterol, fats, and other fatty substances in the blood in children with age of 10 to 17 years who have familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia (an inherited condition in which cholesterol cannot be removed from the body), to treat a genetic condition characterized by increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in adults (Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia), to decrease the progression of the condition of the build-up of fats, fatty substances, and cholesterol in the arteries of the heart (atherosclerosis), and to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, and surgical procedures to restore necessary blood flow to the heart muscles.
HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor
Cemicresto is a prescription medicine that belongs to a class of medicines called HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor. HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors are a class of lipid-lowering medications, effective at lowering high cholesterol levels. These medicines also reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke or developing angina.
How to use
Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia:
•	Start with 20 or 40 mg once daily.
•	If 20 mg is well-tolerated, increase to 40 mg once daily.
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia:
•	Take 40 mg once daily.
Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease:
Primary Prevention:
1.	Patients aged 40 to 75 without diabetes, with LDL-C levels between 70 to 189 mg/dL:
a. If ASCVD 10-year risk = 5% to <7.5%:
•	Take 5 to 10 mg once daily for 30% to 49% LDL-C reduction.
b. If ASCVD 10-year risk ≥7.5% to <20%:	
•	Take 5 to 10 mg once daily for 30% to 49% LDL-C reduction.
c. If ASCVD 10-year risk ≥20%:
•	Take 20 to 40 mg once daily for ≥50% LDL-C reduction.
2.	Patients with diabetes:
a. Ages 40 to 75 without additional ASCVD risk factors:
•	Take 5 to 10 mg once daily for 30% to 49% LDL-C reduction.
b. ASCVD risk ≥20% or multiple risk factors:
•	Take 20 to 40 mg once daily for ≥50% LDL-C reduction.
3.	Patients aged 20 to 75 with LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL:
•	Take 20 to 40 mg once daily for ≥50% LDL-C reduction. This applies regardless of ASCVD risk or diabetes.
Secondary Prevention in Established ASCVD (e.g., Coronary Heart Disease):
•	Take 20 to 40 mg once daily for ≥50% LDL-C reduction.
Pediatric Dosing: Refer to dosage and administration guidelines.

Side Effects:
-Increased serum transaminases and hepatotoxicity, myalgia, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. -Diabetes mellitus, constipation, nausea, cystitis, increased serum alanine aminotransferase, increased serum transaminases, dizziness, headache, arthralgia, asthenia and increased creatine phosphokinase in blood specimen.
Safety Advice:
-Should not be given to patients suffering from hypersensitivity to rosuvastatin. -Rosuvastatin may cause small increases in HbA1c (mean: ~0.1%) and fasting blood glucose. -Adults receiving rosuvastatin 40 mg daily may experience hematuria (microscopic) and proteinuria, which is transient and not associated with a decrease in renal function. -Use with caution in patients who consume large amounts of ethanol and/or have a history of liver disease. -May rarely worsen or precipitate myasthenia gravis. -Dosage adjustment may be required in patients with renal impairment. -Use with caution in patients with advanced age; these patients are more predisposed to myopathy. -In case of over dose be ready to tell or show what was taken, how much and when it happened, and seek immediate medical attention.

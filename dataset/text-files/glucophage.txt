Warnings
Alcohol Consumption
Excessive alcohol consumption may lead to an increased risk of the build-up of lactate in the body (lactic acidosis). Avoid the consumption of alcohol while taking Glucophage.

Build Up of Lactate in the Body
Patients with diabetes, prolonged fasting, alcohol intake, serious infections, liver problems, dehydration, and decreased supply of oxygen are at increased risk when using this medicine. Patients using Glucophage are at an increased risk of low body temperature, low blood pressure, abnormal heartbeat, and fatal conditions. These patients may see an increased level of lactate, Glucophage, lactate/pyruvate ratio, and abnormal levels of negatively charged ions in the blood. Such patients may also develop symptoms of lactic acidosis such as a feeling of discomfort, muscle pain, etc. Discontinue the use of Glucophage in these conditions. Supportive measures and immediate use of a therapy that purifies the blood (hemodialysis) is also recommended.
Severe Conditions of Vomiting, Diarrhea, or Fever
Patients with severe conditions of vomiting, diarrhea, or fever may experience severe loss of water in the body (severe dehydration). Discontinue the use of Glucophage for a shorter time duration and consultation with a doctor is advised.
Iodinated Contrast Agents
Use of iodinated contrast agents which are taken through the blood vessels (intravascular) may increase the risk of the build-up of lactate inside the body, decrease the functioning of the kidney. Discontinue the use of Glucophage before or at the time of treatment with iodinated contrast agents for at least 48 hours. Restart the use of this medicine if the functioning of the kidney becomes stable.
Surgery

Diuretics
Glucophage Tablet may interact with Diuretics such as furosemide, which is used to treat fluid build-up in patients with heart failure or kidney disease and conditions of high blood pressure. Use of furosemide with Glucophage increases the level of Glucophage in the blood. Proper monitoring of the functioning of the kidney and blood glucose levels test is required to adjust the dose of Glucophage.
Calcium Channel Blockers
There may be an interaction of Glucophage with Calcium Channel Blockers such as nifedipine, which is used to treat high blood pressure, and chest pain. When Glucophage is used with nifedipine, the level of Glucophage gets increased in the blood.
Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion Inhibitors
Glucophage Tablet interacts with multidrug and toxin extrusion inhibitors (such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, isavuconazole, trimethoprim, and cimetidine), which are used to treat chest pain, ulcer, cancer, bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Use of Glucophage with multidrug and toxin extrusion inhibitors (MATE), increases the level of Glucophage in the body. It may also increase the risk of lactate buildup in the body. Dose adjustment is needed while using these medicines in combination.
Antihypertensive Agents
Special instructions need to be followed while taking this medicine along with thiazides, diuretics, sympathomimetics, and calcium channel blockers, which are used to treat blood pressure. When Glucophage is used with thiazides, diuretics, sympathomimetics or calcium channel blockers, may lead to loss of blood glucose control. These patients should be observed closely for low blood sugar levels.

How does it work?
When a person is allergic to a certain substance, the human body initiates a series of immune responses on exposure. These immune responses are mediated by chemical substances, chief amongst which is histamine. Histamine produces symptoms like sneezing, cold, cough, increased tear production, etc. Loratadine is an antihistamine that prevents the actions of histamine, thereby decreasing its effects during an episode of allergic response. It also does not produce sedation that is commonly associated with other antihistamines. Pseudoephedrine is a mimetic agent of a receptor called alpha-adrenergic receptor. By mimicking the actions of this receptor, it produces effects like dilatation of airways and constriction of blood vessels. This helps decongestion and makes breathing easier.

Zantac Tablets:
What is in my Zantac?
The medicine in your Zantac tablets
is called ranitidine (as
hydrochloride). This belongs to a
group of medicines called H2-
antagonists.
What does my Zantac
do?
Zantac is mostly used to:
• treat stomach and duodenal
ulcer disease (also known as
peptic ulcer),
• stop these ulcers from coming
back,
• treat reflux oesophagitis (also
known as reflux).
These problems are caused, in part,
by too much acid in the stomach.
This can lead to pain such as
heartburn. Zantac works by
reducing the amount of acid in the
stomach. This reduces the pain and
also allows the ulcer and reflux to
heal.
Zantac is also used to treat:
• Zollinger-Ellison disease,
• scleroderma oesophagitis.

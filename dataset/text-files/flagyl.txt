Flagyl
What is Flagyl?
Flagyl is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections of the vagina, stomach, liver, skin, joints, brain and spinal cord, lungs, heart, or bloodstream.
Flagyl is also used to treat trichomoniasis, a sexually transmitted disease caused by a parasite. Usually both sexual partners are treated at the same time, even if one has no symptoms.
Flagyl belongs to a group of medicines known as anti-microbial agents used to treat bacterial infections of the blood, brain, lung, bone, pelvic area, stomach lining, intestines, gum, teeth, following childbirth or wound infection following an operation. It is also used to treat infected leg ulcers, pressure sores, stomach ulcers caused by Helicobacter pylori, urinary or genital infections caused by Trichomonas parasite, amoebiasis (parasitic infection of the colon), and to prevent infections after surgery.
Flagyl contains metronidazole that works by preventing the production of proteins required by the harmful microorganisms for their survival. Thereby Flagyl treats bacterial and parasitic infections.

Patients undergoing the procedure of blood purification (hemodialysis)
In patients who are undergoing hemodialysis treatment, Flagyl and its metabolites are removed following a period of eight hours of dialysis. Flagyl should be given immediately after performing hemodialysis.
Loss of liver function

Accumulation of Flagyl may occur in patients in whom the functions of the brain are lost when a damaged liver does not remove harmful substances from the blood (liver encephalopathy), and the high levels of Flagyl in the blood may contribute to the symptoms of the encephalopathy. Such patients should take Flagyl with caution, and the daily dose should be reduced to one third and should be given once a day.
